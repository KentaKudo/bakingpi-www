					The OK04 lesson builds on OK03 by teaching how to use the timer to flash the 'OK' or 'ACT'
					LED at precise intervals. It is assumed you have the code for the <a href="ok03.html">
						Lesson 3: OK03</a> operating system as a basis.

						The timer is the only way the Pi can keep time. Most computers have a battery powered
						clock to keep time when off.</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					So far, we've only looked at one piece of hardware on the Raspberry Pi, namely the
					GPIO Controller. I've simply told you what to do, and it happened. Now we're going
					to look at the timer, and I'm going to lead you through understanding how it works.</p>
				<p>
					Just like the GPIO Controller, the timer has an address. In this case, the timer
					is based at 20003000<sub>16</sub>. Reading the manual, we find the following table:</p>

				<p>
					This table tells us a lot, but the descriptions in the manual of the various fields
					tell us the most. The manual explains that the timer fundamentally just increments
					the value in Counter by 1 every 1 micro second. Each time it does so, it compares
					the lowest 32 bits (4 bytes) of the counter's value with the 4 comparison registers,
					and if it matches any of them, it updates Control / Status to reflect which ones
					matched.</p>
				<p>
					For more information about bits, bytes, bit fields, and data sizes expand the box
					below.</p>
				<div class="expandableHeader" onclick="return ExpandToggle('bits')">
					<p>
						<a class="icon-more">Bits explained</a></p>
				</div>
				<div id="bits" class="expandable">
					<p>
						A bit is a name for a single binary digit. As you may recall, a single binary digit
						is either a 1 or a 0.</p>
					<p>
						A byte is the name we give for a collection of 8 bits. Since each bit can be one
						of two values, there are 2<sup>8</sup> = 256 different possible values for a byte.
						We normally interpret a byte as a binary number between 0 and 255 inclusive.</p>
					<img class="sideDiagram" src="images/gpioControllerFunctionSelect.png" alt="Diagram of GPIO function select controller register 0." />
					<p>
						A bit field is another way of interpreting binary. Rather than interpreting it as
						a number, binary can be interpreted as many different things. A bit field treats
						binary as a series of switches which are either on (1) or off (0). If we have a
						meaning for each of these little switches, we can use them to control things. We
						have actually already met bitfields with the GPIO controller, with the setting a
						pin on or off. The bit that was a 1 was the GPIO pin to actually turn on or off.
						Sometimes we need more options than just on or off, so we group several of the switches
						together, such as with the GPIO controller function settings (pictured), in which
						every group of 3 bits controls one GPIO pin function.</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					Our goal is to implement a function that we can call with an amount of time as an
					input that will wait for that amount of time and then return. Think for a moment
					about how we could do this, given what we have.
				</p>
				<p>
					I see there being two options:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Read a value from the counter, and then keep branching back into the same code until
						the counter is the amount of time to wait more than it was.</li>
					<li>Read a value from the counter, add the amount of time to wait, store this in one
						of the comparison registers and then keep branching back into the same code until
						the Control / Status register updates.</li></ol>
				<div class="informationBox">
					<p>
						Issues like these are called concurrency problems, and can be almost impossible
						to fix.</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					Both of these strategies would work fine, but in this tutorial we will only implement
					the first. The reason is because the comparison registers are more likely to go
					wrong, as during the time it takes to add the wait time and store it in the comparison
					register, the counter may have increased, and so it would not match. This could
					lead to very long unintentional delays if a 1 micro second wait is requested (or
					worse, a 0 microsecond wait).</p>
				<h2 id="implementation">
					2 Implementation</h2>
				<div class="informationBox">
					<p>
						Large Operating Systems normally use the Wait function as an opportunity to perform
						background tasks.</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					I will largely leave the challenge of creating the ideal wait method to you. I suggest
					you put all code related to the timer in a file called 'systemTimer.s' (for hopefully
					obvious reasons). The complicated part about this method, is that the counter is
					an 8 byte value, but each register only holds 4 bytes. Thus, the counter value will
					span two registers.</p>
				<p>
					The following code blocks are examples.</p>
				<div class="armCodeBlock">
					<p>
						ldrd r0,r1,[r2,#4]
				</div>
				<div class="commandBox">
					<p>
						<span class="armCodeInline">ldrd regLow,regHigh,[src,#val]</span> loads 8 bytes
						from the address given by the number in <span class="armCodeInline">src</span> plus
						<span class="armCodeInline">val</span> into <span class="armCodeInline">regLow</span>
						and <span class="armCodeInline">regHigh</span>
					.</div>
				<p>
					An instruction you may find useful is the <span class="armCodeInline">ldrd</span>
					instruction above. It loads 8 bytes of memory across 2 registers. In this case,
					the 8 bytes of memory starting at the address in <span class="armCodeInline">r2</span>
					would be copied into <span class="armCodeInline">r0</span> and <span class="armCodeInline">
						r1</span>. What is slightly complicated about this arrangement is that <span class="armCodeInline">
							r1</span> actually holds the highest 4 bytes. In other words, if the counter
					had a value of 999,999,999,999<sub>10</sub> = 1110100011010100101001010000111111111111<sub>2</sub>,
					<span class="armCodeInline">r1</span> would contain 11101000<sub>2</sub> and <span
						class="armCodeInline">r0</span> would contain 11010100101001010000111111111111<sub>2</sub>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The most sensible way to implement this would be to compute the difference between
					the current counter value and the one from when the method started, and then to
					compare this with the requested amount of time to wait. Conveniently, unless you
					wish to support wait times that were 8 bytes, the value in <span class="armCodeInline">
						r1</span> in the example above could be discarded, and only the low 4 bytes
					of the counter need be used.</p>
				<p>
					When waiting you should always be sure to use higher comparisons not equality comparisons,
					as if you try to wait for the gap between the time the method started and the time
					it ends to be exactly the amount requested, you could miss the value, and wait forever.</p>
				<p>
					If you cannot figure out how to code the wait function, expand the box below for
					a guide.</p>
				<div class="expandableHeader" onclick="return ExpandToggle('waitfunc')">
					<p>
						<a class="icon-more">Wait function implementation</a></p>
				</div>
				<div id="waitfunc" class="expandable">
					<p>
						Borrowing the idea from the GPIO controller, the first function we should write
						should be to get the address of this system timer. An example of this is shown below:</p>
					<div class="armCodeBlock">
						<p>
							.globl GetSystemTimerBase<br />
							GetSystemTimerBase:
							<br />
							ldr r0,=0x20003000<br />
							mov pc,lr<br />
					</div>
					<p>
						Another function that will prove useful would be one that returns the current counter
						value in registers <span class="armCodeInline">r0</span> and <span class="armCodeInline">
							r1</span>:</p>
					<div class="armCodeBlock">
						<p>
							.globl GetTimeStamp<br />
							GetTimeStamp:<br />
							push {lr}<br />
							bl GetSystemTimerBase<br />
							ldrd r0,r1,[r0,#4]<br />
							pop {pc}<br />
					</div>
					<p>
						This function simply uses the GetSystemTimerBase function and loads in the counter
						value using <span class="armCodeInline">ldrd</span> like we have just learned.</p>
					<p>
						Now we actually want to code our wait method. First of all, we need to know the
						counter value when the method started, which we can now get using GetTimeStamp.</p>
					<div class="armCodeBlock">
						<p>
							delay .req r2<br />
							mov delay,r0<br />
							push {lr}<br />
							bl GetTimeStamp<br />
							start .req r3<br />
							mov start,r0<br />
					</div>
					<p>
						This code copies our method's input, the amount of time to delay, into <span class="armCodeInline">
							r2</span>, and then calls GetTimeStamp, which we know will return the current
						counter value in <span class="armCodeInline">r0</span> and <span class="armCodeInline">
							r1</span>. It then copies the lower 4 bytes of the counter's value to <span class="armCodeInline">
								r3</span>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Next we need to compute the difference between the current counter value and the
						reading we just took, and then keep doing so until the gap between them is at least
						the size of <span class="armCodeInline">delay</span>.</p>
					<div class="armCodeBlock">
						<p>
							loop$:<br />
							<div class="indent">
								<p>
									bl GetTimeStamp<br />
									elapsed .req r1<br />
									sub elapsed,r0,start<br />
									cmp elapsed,delay<br />
									.unreq elapsed<br />
									bls loop$<br />
							</div>
					</div>
					<p>
						This code will wait until the requested amount of time has passed. It takes a reading
						from the counter, subtracts the initial value from this reading and then compares
						that to the requested delay. If the amount of time that has elapsed is less than
						the requested delay, it branches back to <span class="armCodeInline">loop$</span>.</p>
					<div class="armCodeBlock">
						<p>
							.unreq delay<br />
							.unreq start<br />
							pop {pc}<br />
					</div>
					<p>
						This code finishes off the function by returning.</p>
				</div>

					Once you have what you believe to be a working wait function, change 'main.s' to
					use it. Alter everywhere you wait to set the value of r0 to some big number (remember
					it is in microseconds) and then test it on the Raspberry Pi. If it does not function
					correctly please see our troubleshooting page.</p>
				<p>
					Once it is working, congratulations you have now mastered another device, and with
					it, time itself. In the next and final lesson in the OK series, <a href="ok05.html">
						Lesson 5: OK05</a> we shall use all we have learned to flash out a pattern on
					the LED.</p>
